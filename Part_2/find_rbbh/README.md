# README.md - find_rbbh

##Â Overview

This directory contains files for in-class activity centred around reciprocal best BLAST hits (RBBH). The activities and explanation are in the iPython notebook `find_rbbh.ipynb`, which should be started using:

```
ipython notebook --pylab inline
```

and selecting `find_rbbh` in the browser window that appears.

The shell script `run_rbbh_blast.sh` should already have been run to generate data in the `rbbh_output` directory. If this is missing, then issuing

```
./run_rbbh_blast.sh
```

should regenerate the output.
